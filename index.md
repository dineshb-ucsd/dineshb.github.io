I am an Associate Professor in the ECE department with an affiliate appointment with the CSE department at UC San Diego. Our group [WCSNG](https://wcsng.ucsd.edu) designs systems for Wireless Communication, Computing, Sensing, and Networking at UC San Diego. 

The vision for our research is to design and prototype performant systems for communicating, sensing, computing, and securing information in our connected world, solving real-world problems. Our research has aimed to solve fundamental questions, which has often led to new areas of research and commercialization. 

[WCSNG](https://wcsng.ucsd.edu) group consists of highly interdisciplinary engineers, spanning electrical engineers, data scientists, computer scientists, and mechanical engineers, and works at the intersection of computing, signal processing, circuits, computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. We develop science and algorithms and their real-world implementation and prototypes in our impact areas. 

Our broad impact areas are vision/perception systems, sensing systems, wireless communications, computing systems, and wireless networking. WCSNG group has curated and created various open-source datasets and tools that enable reproducible research and eases barriers to entry for researchers in computing, communication, and sensing.

<h5> PhD and Postdoc </h5>
Send an email with the subject "Application PhD" or "Application Postdoc" directly to <i>dineshb [at] ucsd.edu</i> with your CV and a brief statement of why you are interested.
<h5> UCSD students </h5>
We routinely work with graduate and undergraduate students on all our projects. Contact Dinesh (or any other group member) via email or stop by the office to express your interest.
<h5> Students from Elsewhere </h5>
Sometimes, we work with students on summer internships if we get exceptional applicants. This usually means good academic standing and a personal recommendation.
