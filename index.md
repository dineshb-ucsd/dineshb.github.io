I am Associate Professor in the ECE department with an affiliate appointment with the CSE department at UC San Diego. Our group [WCSNG](https://wcsng.ucsd.edu) designs systems for Wireless Communication, Computing, Sensing, and Networking at UC San Diego.

The vision for our research is to design and prototype performant systems for communicating, sensing, computing, and securing information in our connected world, solving real-world problems. Our research has aimed to solve fundamental questions, which has often led to new areas of research and commercialization.

[WCSNG](https://wcsng.ucsd.edu) group consists of highly interdisciplinary engineers, spanning electrical engineers, data scientists, computer scientists, and mechanical engineers, and works at the intersection of computing, signal processing, circuits, computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. We develop science and algorithms and their real-world implementation and prototypes in our impact areas.

Our broad impact areas are vision/perception systems, sensing systems, wireless communications, computing systems, and wireless networking. WCSNG group has curated and created various open-source datasets and tools that enable reproducible research and eases barriers to entry for researchers in computing, communication, and sensing.

Short Bio
-----

I have been at UC San Diego as a faculty since January 2018. My group has diverse focus from computer vision, deep learning to wireless communication, sensing and networking. We build from theory to practice technologies which have impact on robotics, autonomous systems and day-to-day life.

Previously, I worked as postdoctoral associate at MIT CSAIL, focusing on data-center networking and wireless sensing. I received my Ph.D. at Stanford University for my work on full-duplex radios, which were considered near impossible to build, basically enabling radios to transmit and receive simultaneously on the same frequency. From 2013 to 2015, I took a leave of absence from my Ph.D. to commercialize research on the practical full-duplex radio at Kumu Networks, which underwent successful field trials with tier 1 network providers worldwide â€“ Deutsche Telekom and SK Telecom and is now being commercially deployed.

Before joining Stanford, I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur in 2010. I was awarded a gold medal at IIT Kanpur for graduating at the top of the class of 2010 in Electrical Engineering.

Broader Industry Impact
-----

- Full Duplex
Our research on full-duplex radios has translated into a commercial venture [Kumu Networks](http://www.kumunetworks.com). I worked as a Principal Scientist at Kumu Networks for nearly two years to commercialize this research and bring it to the rest of the world.

At Kumu Networks, I led the technology (both architecture and algorithm design) for in-band full duplex radios to build a commercial product. The product completed successful field trials with major Tier 1 network providers -- [Deutsche Telekom](https://www.telekom.com/media/company/288612) and [SK Telecom](http://telecoms.com/423101/skt-and-kumu-show-off-full-duplex-5g-tech/) and is now being commercially deployed. To this date, it is the only successful commercial demonstration of full duplex radios.

Due to its proven commercial viability and promise, full duplex is now actively being designed into next-generation wireless standards. Both 5G cellular and next-generation WiFi standards are incorporating full duplex or self-interference cancellation technology in various forms.
